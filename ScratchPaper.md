### Possible scratch dialogue
You look back up at your desk.
Piled a few inches high
you see papers, bills, notice of collections
that you've received over the last several months.
The weight that's been sitting on your chest
is much more than your pet cat.
You close your eyes
hoping that maybe, when you open them,
the papers will not be there.
